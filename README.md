# Maurits Silvis

> Software Engineer • Computational Scientist • PhD

Hi there!
My name is Maurits.
I am a software engineer with a background in computational science and physics, and I love solving complex challenges using code.

Presently, I am a full-stack web developer at d.velop mobile services, an IT service provider specializing in mobile and web applications.
Previously, I was a software engineer at beQualified, where I worked on a test automation framework for web applications.
I also have a PhD in mechanical engineering, for which I improved the accuracy and fidelity of numerical predictions of turbulent fluid flows.

Moving forward, I would like to contribute to creating high-quality simulation software for high-tech, deep-tech or engineering applications.
