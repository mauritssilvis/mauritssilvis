# Maurits Silvis

> Software Engineer | Mechanical Engineer | Computational Scientist | PhD

Hi there!
My name is Maurits Silvis. 
As a software engineer with a background in mechanical engineering, computational science and physics, I love solving complex problems using code.

Until recently, I worked as a software engineer at beQualified, where I developed, maintained and tested a Java-based test automation framework for web applications.
Previously, I obtained a PhD in mechanical engineering, for which I improved the accuracy and fidelity of numerical predictions of turbulent fluid flows.
I also was a visiting researcher at several universities.

Moving forward, I would like to contribute to creating high-quality software for solving technological challenges.
Therefore, I am currently looking for a position as a software engineer for high-tech, deep-tech or engineering applications.
