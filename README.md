> Software Engineer | Mechanical Engineer | Computational Scientist | PhD

Hi there! My name is Maurits Silvis. As a software engineer with a background in mechanical engineering, computational science and physics, I love solving complex problems using code.

Until recently, I worked as a software engineer at beQualified GmbH, where I developed and maintained a Java-based test automation framework for web applications.
Previously, I obtained a PhD in mechanical engineering, for which I improved the accuracy and fidelity of numerical predictions of turbulent fluid flows.
I also was a visiting researcher at several universities.
