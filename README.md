# Maurits Silvis

> Software Engineer • Computational Scientist • PhD

Hi there!
My name is Maurits Silvis.
As a software engineer with a background in computational science and physics, I love solving complex challenges using code.

I recently started as a full-stack developer at d.velop mobile services, an IT service provider specializing in creating mobile apps.
Previously, I worked as a software engineer at beQualified, where I developed, maintained and tested a test automation framework for web applications.
I also obtained a PhD in mechanical engineering, for which I improved the accuracy and fidelity of numerical predictions of turbulent fluid flows.

Moving forward, I would like to contribute to creating simulation software for high-tech, deep-tech or engineering applications.
